=== Compilation 

Launch script 'make.bat' (which is located in directory +SPRINT X/OPTI+) to compile source files and generate all
documentations. Note that, by default, documentations are created from files +SPRINT X/OPTI/srcdoc/doc*.txt+.

TIP: You can display an execution trace in the terminal. To this end, open file 'src/log/Logger.java' and set the
value of the variable +IS_LOGGER_ACTIVATED+ to 'true'.


==== Source files' compilation

If you only want to compile source files, you should launch the 'compile.bat' batch file. This script is located in
the directory +SPRINT X/OPTI/scripts+. +
 +
This script will compile the files '*.java' located in directory +SPRINT X/OPTI/src+.

IMPORTANT: To launch this file, you have to be located in the directory's parent (+SPRINT X/OPTI+)


==== Documentations' generation

if you only want to generate the documentations, you ought to use the batch file 'createDocumentation.bat', which is
located in the directory +SPRINT X/OPTI/scripts+. +
