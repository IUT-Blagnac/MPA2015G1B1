== Software's Presentation

=== Introduction

The students who are in the second year of studies in the Technical Institute of Blagnac
have Tutored Project to make in team. +
 +
These projects need to be carefully managed because they involve lots of actors, such as
the students, their supervisor or the client. +
Moreover, many subjects are offered to the students. To assign them in the best possible way,
the teams have to rank these subjects as wishes.

Thus, OPTI Project's aim is to product an application which makes tutored projects' management easier.

=== Framework of Realization

This software has been developped by 6 students in second year of studies in the Technical
